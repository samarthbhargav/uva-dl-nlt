# Possible ideas

Sentence representations
Long sequence classification with LSTM (Sequence labeling)
CNN-like moving windows of words sequences
Summarization
Random forest
Bag-of-words model
Numbers etc. tagging or Named Entity Recognition to be fed as features
LDA Latent Dirichlet Allocation given as a feature to DL

Binary cross entropy for the loss
Batches pad packed sequences etc. to make training faster
